# Plotting in Base `R`

You will use the basic `R` plotting to make a map showing climate categories, country and state outlines and points for koalas observations and then save the map to a png file

Data: output from raster and interaction section are used

## Challenge 1: Make a simple map

```{r}
# plot to set extent
par(mar = c(2,2,2,2))

plot(climate_au, 
     legend = FALSE, 
     col = colors, 
     main = "Koala occurrence in different states and climates", 
     key.pos = NULL)

# plot with colors for levels of factor (filled / outline)

# add the state outlines

plot(states2, 
     add = TRUE, 
     col = NA, 
     border = "red")# play with col and border!

polygonsLabel(states2, 
              labels = states2$Freq, 
              method = "centroid", 
              col = "red")

plot(koala_sf, 
     add = TRUE, 
     pch = 10) #,cex is a rough SHOULD WE ADD A COLUMN FOR E.G. male/female to have them add color categories?

# way to change the size of symbols or text, pch sets the symbol, feel free to play around
#map.axes(cex.axis=0.8) # here cex specifies font size # only needed if not there yet

maps::map.scale(120, 
                -40, 
                relwidth = 0.25, 
                metric = TRUE,
                ratio = FALSE, 
                cex = 0.6) # exchange TRUE and FALSE to see what they

colors <- c("white", 
            "yellow", 
            "lightgreen",
            "darkgreen",
            "lightblue",
            "blue",
            "purple",
            "red")

leg <- c("dry cold", "dry cool", "dry warm", "dry hot",
            "wet cold", "wet cool", "wet warm", "wet hot")# c(11,12,13,14,21,22,23,24)

par(xpd = NA) # to enable to plot outside of plotting area
legend(155, 
       y = -15, 
       legend = leg, 
       fill = colors)
```
