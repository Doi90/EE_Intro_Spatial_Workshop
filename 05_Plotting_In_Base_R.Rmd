# Plotting in Base R

You will use the basic R plotting to make a map showing climate categories, country and state outlines and points for koalas observations and then save the map to a png file

Data: output from raster and interaction section are used

# Challenge 1: Make a simple map
```{r}
# plot to set extent
par(mar = c(2,2,2,2))
plot(climate_au, legend=F, col=colors, main="Koala occurrence in different states and climates", key.pos = NULL)
# plot with colors for levels of factor (filled / outline)

# add the state outlines
plot(states2, add=TRUE, col=NA, border="red")# play with col and border!
polygonsLabel(states2, labels = states2$Freq, method = "centroid", col = "red")
plot(koala_sf, add=TRUE, pch = 10) #,cex is a rough SHOULD WE ADD A COLUMN FOR E.G. male/female to have them add color categories?
# way to change the size of symbols or text, pch sets the symbol, feel free to play around
#map.axes(cex.axis=0.8) # here cex specifies font size # only needed if not there yet
maps::map.scale(120,-40, relwidth = 0.25, metric = TRUE,
                ratio = FALSE, cex=0.6) # exchange TRUE and FALSE to see what they

colors <- c("white", "yellow", "lightgreen","darkgreen", "lightblue", "blue", "purple","red")
leg <- c("dry cold", "dry cool", "dry warm", "dry hot",
            "wet cold", "wet cool", "wet warm", "wet hot")# c(11,12,13,14,21,22,23,24)

par(xpd=NA) # to enable to plot outside of plotting area
legend(155, y=-15, legend = leg, fill = colors)

```
